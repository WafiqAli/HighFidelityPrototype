# HighFidelityPrototype
A CS345 (HCI) assignment that focused on redesigning a website by producing a high fidelity prototype. The main focus was to apply the appropriate visual design principles to improve functionality and ease of use. I also had to take accessibility guidelines into account in this assignment. Explanation for rationale in the report. 
I do not own any images that were used in this assignment
